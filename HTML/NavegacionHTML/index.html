    <h2>Bienvenido a Hole</h2>
    <p>
        Hole es una localizacion muy industrializada, con muchas cosas
         por realizar en ella. This is why it has been categorized as a megacity,
         which is a very large city with a population of thousands of 
         people. This, of course, gives The Hole a lot going for it which means that there is a lot for this very large population to do.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Since the beginning of mankind, the Magic Users came to the Hole 
        in order to test their magic on humans, killing or disfiguring 
        them. Thanks to their constant attacks, Hole became a hideous and 
        dangerous place for everyone. The overall population of the city 
        lives in poor conditions, most of them struggling to live with 
        the burdens imposed by the sorcerers' magic on their bodies and the constant fear of being used as guinea pigs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The buildings also show signs of extensive deterioration, with
         several areas of the city consisting of disheveled buildings, 
         as if the entire city is one massive slum. The overall look 
         of the city is a field of buildings and dark corridors. The 
         city was created around the Lake of Refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rain which falls on the Hole is caused by the residues 
        of magic smoke that are in the sky, causing a thin layer of 
        black dust to accumulate with the falling rain. The rain is
         toxic to magic users, as the residue contained within the 
         rain causes harm to their bodies. For example, the rain 
         causes Nikaido to become so sick that she was unable to 
         leave her house.

        <h3> Hungry Bug </h3>
        <p>
            Hungry Bug is a restaurant owned by Nikaido located in a 
            outlying district of Hole, close to the infamous passage where 
            Kaiman was found. The area is well known to be frequented by 
            the Magic Users, and due to this, customers tend to be rare.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hungry Bug is a dirty, small building that's partly infested 
            with cockroaches. The interior of the kitchen has big pipes 
            running near the ceiling with multiple pork bodies and other 
            various cuts of meat hooked onto the pipes.

        <h3> The Hospital </h3>
        <p>
            Created after a young Shin annihilated 
            Hole's militia and the humans gave up 
            trying to defend themselves against 
            Magic Users, because of that, the Magic 
            Users trips to Hole increased so much 
            that the city has to make a special 
            sector for people injured or morphed by 
            magic, mostly just prolonging their 
            inevitable death or poorly improve their 
            lives. Most of the patients come in 
            critical condition and because there is 
            no cure to magic (except by killing the 
            sorcerer who curse them), victims live 
            the rest of their lives in that condition.

            Prof. Kasukabe usually goes to the 
            Hospital with Jonson to keep Vaux 
            company (even though Jonson could not 
            be able to stay there due the fact he is 
            a mutated giant cockroach).

            The Hospital was took over by the remains 
            of the En Family when they scaped from the 
            Magic User realm due sudden the apocalyptic 
            rain, and helping Vaux with the daily 
            chores like cleaning, making coffee and 
            bringing the newspaper to him (he was 
            terrorized by their presence but got used to 
            it). Vaux tried to get rid the Family Goons 
            with the notice that the top members of the 
            organization died in the sinking of the 
            Central Department Store, the notice was 
            actually effective making the goons storm out 
            the hospital.

            The Central Department Store is a commercial building
             in Hole erected over the reclaimed land of "The Lake 
             of Refuse" and centered primarily in the latest arc of 
             the manga, playing an important role in the climax of 
             the story.
